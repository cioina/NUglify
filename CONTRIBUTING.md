# Notice

This project is an attempt to keep alive the original AjaxMin project developed by Ron Logan & contributors.

I (xoofx) highly invite people to help to fix issues they find in this project, as I can't afford myself to be the sole maintainer of this project.

In other words, **Pull Requests (PR) are much welcome** and most likely the only way for you to get your issue fixed and to help to keep this project alive.

Thank you!
